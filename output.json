    "behavior_in_task_description": {
        "explanation": "Instruction.md details all core behaviors tested: multi-CSV ingest, encoding detection, column standardization, type/date handling, median/'Unknown' imputations, 1st/99th outlier clipping, consolidation, and JSON logging, plus shell commands matching tests (e.g., encoding-detection, name-standardization, type-detection, date-parsing, outlier-truncate, dataframe-cleaning, dataframe-consolidation, file-processing, cleaning_log, csv-summary, get-operations). Error handling scenarios are also described.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "behavior_in_tests": {
        "explanation": "Tests cover the described functionality: encoding detection (UTF-8/Latin-1/nonexistent), name standardization, column type detection, date parsing to ISO, outlier clipping with JSON, single-file cleaning with standardized columns, multi-file consolidation, full pipeline with JSON logs and required operations, missing-value imputations (numeric/categorical), CSV summary, and log retrieval. Only some error cases (invalid/empty CSV) from the narrative are not explicitly tested, but core requirements are exercised.",
        "outcome": "pass"

    "informative_test_structure": {
        "explanation": "tests/test_outputs.py is organized with clear sections, descriptive test names and docstrings, fixtures for input CSVs, and a helper to extract JSON. Comments delineate functional areas (type detection, date parsing, outliers, cleaning, consolidation, logs, summary).",

    },
    "anti_cheating_measures": {
        "explanation": "No answers embedded; no network reliance. The image does not include tests/solution. Tests generate/read local CSVs and validate outputs/JSON, requiring real processing rather than trivial string matching.",

    "structured_data_schema": {
        "explanation": "Instruction.md provides example JSON outputs (csv-summary, outlier result, cleaning log) but does not define normative schemas or required keys formally. It’s example-driven rather than specifying exact schemas.",
