{
    "behavior_in_task_description": {
        "explanation": "Instruction lists all required behaviors and CLI interfaces tested: encoding detection, column standardization, type detection, date parsing, outlier clipping, cleaning, consolidation, logging, and csv-summary. 'Available Bash Commands' exactly match test commands; examples show JSON log structure and outlier JSON keys.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "behavior_in_tests": {
        "explanation": "Tests cover all core behaviors described: encoding (UTF-8/Latin-1), name standardization, type detection (numeric/date/categorical), date parsing, outlier clipping, single-file cleaning, multi-file consolidation, full pipeline with log, operations retrieval, csv summary, and some error cases. Only minor non-core scenarios (e.g., invalid/empty CSV) are not exercised.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "informative_test_structure": {
        "explanation": "Tests are organized with clear section comments, descriptive test names/docstrings, fixtures for sample data, and a helper to run shell commands and extract JSON, improving readability and maintenance.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "anti_cheating_measures": {
        "explanation": "No tests/solutions are embedded in the image; inputs are generated dynamically in tests, preventing trivial hardcoding. No reliance on mutable external ground truth. The agent cannot see tests at run time.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "structured_data_schema": {
        "explanation": "Instruction provides explicit examples of the JSON log structure (timestamp, operations with operation/details/timestamp) and outlier-truncate JSON keys, and documents output artifacts (cleaned CSV and JSON log). Interfaces specify output/log filename arguments.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "pinned_dependencies": {
        "explanation": "Dockerfile pins Python deps (datetime==5.5, pandas==2.3.3, numpy==2.0.2). Test-only deps are pinned and installed via uv in tests/test.sh. Apt packages are unpinned, which is acceptable.",
        "outcome": "pass"
    },
    "typos": {
        "explanation": "Several documentation typos/formatting issues: 'CSV Ingester`CSVIngester.py`)' stray backtick/paren; inconsistent numbering in Installation; minor grammar ('Merges multiple cleaned CSV file'); project structure tree formatting inconsistencies. These could cause confusion about file references.",
        "outcome": "fail"

    "file_reference_mentioned": {
        "explanation": "Instruction explicitly documents output file expectations and CLI parameters for output and log files (e.g., 'file-processing <output_file> <log_file> ...') and shows examples. Tests supply filenames via these arguments.",
