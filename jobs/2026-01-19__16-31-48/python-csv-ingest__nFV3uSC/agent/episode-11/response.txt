  "analysis": "Good! CSVIngester has all the main methods. However, I notice that some method signatures may differ from what my tests expect. For example, `detect_column_type` and `date_parser` take a series as parameter, but my tests might be calling them differently. Let me check the actual implementation to understand the method signatures better and then run tests.",
  "plan": "1. Check the actual implementation of key methods (detect_column_type, date_parser) to understand their signatures\n2. Adjust tests if needed or verify they will work\n3. Run a subset of tests first to identify any issues\n4. Fix any issues\n5. Run full test suite",
