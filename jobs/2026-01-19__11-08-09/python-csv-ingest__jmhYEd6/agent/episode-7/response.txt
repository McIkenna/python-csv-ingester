  "analysis": "The project initially lacked the required solution files. I created solution/CSVIngester.py and solution/solve.sh, installed pandas/numpy/pytest, and implemented all required features: multi-file ingestion with encoding detection (UTF-8 and Latin-1), column name standardization to snake_case, robust column type detection (numeric/date/categorical), ISO-8601 date parsing of mixed formats via dateutil, missing value imputation (numeric -> median, categorical -> 'Unknown'), numeric outlier clipping at 1st/99th percentiles, and comprehensive JSON logging of operations. I verified functionality: default CLI execution consolidating src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv produced tests/cleaned.csv and tests/log.json. The cleaned CSV shows ISO-formatted order_date and ship_date; type-detection for 'Order Date' returns 'date', and the log includes 'parse_dates' operations. The shell interface functions in solution/solve.sh wrap the Python CLI as required.",
  "plan": "No further action is needed. The CLI and shell wrappers are implemented and verified to meet the requirements. If desired, you can run more commands using the provided solve.sh functions or run the Python CLI with -o/-l options.",
