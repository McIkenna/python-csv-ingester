  "analysis": "We created the required CLI (solution/CSVIngester.py) and shell interface (solution/solve.sh), installed dependencies, and ran the pipeline to produce a consolidated cleaned dataset and a JSON operations log. We iterated on date detection and parsing; the latest implementation uses python-dateutil for robust detection/parsing and should identify date columns and convert them to ISO format. Outputs tests/cleaned.csv and tests/log.json were generated. Now we should verify that 'Order Date' is detected as date, that cleaned CSV shows ISO-formatted dates, and that the log contains a 'parse_dates' operation.",
