  "analysis": "We created the solution directory and implemented solution/CSVIngester.py and solution/solve.sh. Dependencies (pandas, numpy, pytest) were installed. The CLI script executed successfully: encoding detection, csv summary, and a full file-processing run on src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv produced output.csv and log.json, and the log shows operations applied. However, I noticed in the log that date columns were detected as categorical in the sample, which might be due to the current detection threshold. We can inspect the sample CSVs and verify subcommands like name-standardization, type-detection, and outlier-truncate, and adjust detection heuristics if needed.",
  "plan": "- Inspect the sample CSV(s) to understand date formats and column names.\n- Exercise the subcommands to verify outputs (name-standardization, type-detection, outlier-truncate).\n- If date columns are not detected properly, adjust detection threshold and re-run a quick pipeline to confirm date parsing is logged.\n- Demonstrate default CLI usage with -o and -l options and show get-operations output.\n",
