  "analysis": "The repository initially only had src with two sample CSVs and no tests or solution script. I created the main CLI at src/CSVIngester.py implementing the required features (encoding detection, column name standardization, type detection, date parsing to ISO, median and 'Unknown' imputations, outlier clipping at 1st/99th percentiles, consolidation, and JSON logging). I also added a shell wrapper solution/solve.sh exposing the requested commands. pandas, numpy, and pytest were installed, but the provided tests directory doesn't exist in this environment, so pytest fails to find tests. Next, we should demonstrate running the CLI on the available sample CSVs, generate cleaned output and logs, and exercise a few shell functions.",
  "plan": "- Inspect sample CSVs to understand columns\n- Run the Python CLI to process src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv, outputting consolidated cleaned CSV and a JSON log under output/\n- Show a preview of the cleaned CSV and display part of the log to verify operations\n- Source the shell wrapper and demonstrate a couple of helper commands: encoding detection and column name standardization\n- Optionally show a CSV summary via the shell wrapper",
