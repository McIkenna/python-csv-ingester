  "analysis": "We created the core Python CLI (src/CSVIngester.py) and a Bash wrapper (solution/solve.sh). We processed the two sample CSVs successfully, generating output/cleaned_data.csv and output/cleaning_log.json. The cleaned CSV shows standardized columns, ISO dates, imputations, and outlier clipping (e.g., quantity and stock_qty truncated). The cleaning log contains detailed operations. The shell wrapper works for encoding-detection and name-standardization. The csv-summary command printed only the label; likely the CLI invocation needs validation. We'll directly invoke the CLI summary to confirm and adjust usage if needed, and demonstrate other helper commands.",
  "plan": "- Run the CLI summary directly to verify JSON summary output\n- Re-run the wrapper's csv-summary (if needed) and adjust if an issue is found\n- Demonstrate type detection and outlier stats via wrapper\n- Show getting operations from the produced log JSON",
