  "analysis": "The project initially lacked tests and the solution script, but we implemented the full Python CLI (src/CSVIngester.py) and the shell wrapper (solution/solve.sh). The CLI handles multiple CSVs with inconsistent schemas, detects encodings, standardizes column names, detects and parses various date formats to ISO, imputes missing numerics with median and categoricals with 'Unknown', clips numeric outliers at the 1st/99th percentiles, consolidates data, and logs all operations to JSON. We validated on sample CSVs, generated output/cleaned_data.csv and output/cleaning_log.json, and verified multiple shell commands including encoding detection, name standardization, type detection, outlier stats, csv-summary, date-parsing, and log retrieval. Warnings from pandas date parsing were silenced, and error handling for nonexistent files was added.",
  "plan": "No further actions are needed. The CLI and shell interface meet the requirements, and example runs produced the expected cleaned output and logs.",
