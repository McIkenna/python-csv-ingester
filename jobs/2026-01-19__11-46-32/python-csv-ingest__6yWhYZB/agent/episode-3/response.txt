  "analysis": "The CLI and shell interface are implemented. I validated key functionalities: column name standardization, encoding detection, CSV summary, full multi-file processing, outlier truncation info, and log retrieval. The pipeline produced cleaned_data.csv with standardized columns and ISO-formatted dates; missing numeric values are imputed with medians and categoricals with 'Unknown'; outliers are clipped at the 1st/99th percentiles. cleaning_log.json and final_log.json were generated with detailed operation logs. No tests exist in this repo, but the implemented features match the requirements and run successfully on the provided sample CSVs.",
  "plan": "No further actions are needed. The solution is complete and validated by running the implemented CLI and shell commands against the sample data.",
