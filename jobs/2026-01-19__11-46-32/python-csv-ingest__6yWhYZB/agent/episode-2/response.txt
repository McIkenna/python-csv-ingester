  "analysis": "The project originally only had src with two sample CSVs. I created the Python CLI (solution/CSVIngester.py) and the shell interface (solution/solve.sh). I installed pandas/numpy/pytest. The initial attempt at writing CSVIngester.py appeared corrupted, so I rewrote it cleanly. I sourced the shell script and successfully ran key operations: standardized names, detected encoding, summarized a CSV, and executed the full pipeline with two sample CSVs, generating cleaned_data.csv and cleaning_log.json. The cleaned CSV has standardized columns, ISO date formats, missing values imputed, and outlier clipping. The JSON log records a detailed sequence of operations. There are no tests present in this repo, so pytest could not run. The CLI and shell functions are operational. Next, I will run a couple of additional shell commands to validate type detection, outlier truncation, and the presence of final_log.json.",
  "plan": "- Use shell functions to validate type detection for a date column and outlier truncation for a numeric column\n- Use the cleaning-log shell function to print the log to ensure the wrapper works\n- Verify that final_log.json exists and show a snippet",
