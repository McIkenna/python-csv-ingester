  "analysis": "We are in /app with an unknown project state. We need to implement a Python CLI and bash wrapper according to the specification, but first we must inspect the repository to see what's present (solution files, tests) and understand the expected interfaces from the tests. We'll explore the directory, read the tests, and then implement or modify the solution/CSVIngester.py and solution/solve.sh accordingly. We'll also set execute permissions and run pytest to iterate.",
  "plan": "1) List files/directories to understand the project structure. 2) Inspect tests/test_outputs.py to derive exact expected functions/CLI behaviors. 3) Check if solution/CSVIngester.py and solution/solve.sh exist; if not, create them. If they exist, adjust to meet tests. 4) Implement CSVIngester class with required methods and a CLI entry point to process CSVs, handle encoding, standardize columns, detect types, parse dates, impute missing values, clip outliers, consolidate data, and log operations to JSON. 5) Implement solve.sh with the bash interface functions calling the Python script. 6) Make scripts executable. 7) Run pytest to validate and iterate if necessary.",
