  "analysis": "The Python CLI (src/CSVIngester.py) and shell wrapper (solution/solve.sh) are implemented. The CLI supports encoding detection, column name standardization, type detection, date parsing to ISO, numeric median imputation, categorical 'Unknown' imputation, outlier clipping at 1st/99th percentiles, single-file cleaning, multi-file consolidation, and full pipeline with JSON logging. Test CSVs were created and used. The full pipeline was executed successfully, producing tests/cleaned_data.csv and tests/cleaning_log.json, with 44 operations logged. Shell functions and direct Python invocations both work. Pandas emitted parsing warnings (non-fatal).",
