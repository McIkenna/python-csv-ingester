  "analysis": "I've updated the CSVIngester.py file to fix the standardize_column_name method. The fix was to replace underscores with spaces first, then process the name, which ensures that 'customer_name' stays as 'customer_name' after standardization. I also fixed the pandas FutureWarning by using direct assignment instead of inplace operations. Now I need to re-run the tests to verify all tests pass.",
