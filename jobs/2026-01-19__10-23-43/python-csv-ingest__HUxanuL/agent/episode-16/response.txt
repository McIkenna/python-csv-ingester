Perfect! The implementation is complete and fully functional. Let me create a final summary:

{
  "analysis": "All requirements have been successfully implemented and verified:\n\n✅ Python CLI (CSVIngester.py) - Fully functional\n✅ Multiple CSV inputs with inconsistent schemas - Tested and working\n✅ Standardized column names (snake_case) - Implemented\n✅ ISO-8601 date formatting - All dates converted to YYYY-MM-DD\n✅ Missing numerics imputed with median - Working\n✅ Missing categoricals filled with 'Unknown' - Working\n✅ Outliers clipped at 1st/99th percentiles - Implemented\n✅ Consolidated cleaned dataset output - Generated successfully\n✅ JSON log of operations - Comprehensive logging with timestamps\n✅ Bash interface (solve.sh) - All 11 commands working\n✅ Test suite - 25/25 tests passing\n✅ Complete documentation - instruction.md created\n\nThe system successfully processes multiple CSV files with different schemas (sample1_data.csv with orders, sample2_data.csv with products), standardizes column names, handles missing values, clips outliers, parses various date formats, and outputs both cleaned data and operation logs.",
  "plan": "Task is complete. All requirements from the specification have been met:\n\n1. Python CLI ingests multiple CSVs with inconsistent schemas ✓\n2. Column standardization to snake_case ✓\n3. Date parsing to ISO-8601 format ✓\n4. Median imputation for numeric missing values ✓\n5. 'Unknown' imputation for categorical missing values ✓\n6. Outlier clipping at 1st/99th percentiles ✓\n7. Consolidated cleaned dataset output ✓\n8. JSON operation log ✓\n9. Bash interface with all required functions ✓\n10. Comprehensive test suite (25 passing tests) ✓\n11. Complete documentation ✓",
