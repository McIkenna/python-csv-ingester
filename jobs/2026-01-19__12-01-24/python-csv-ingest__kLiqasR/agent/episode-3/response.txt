  "analysis": "We created the solution directory and implemented solution/CSVIngester.py and solution/solve.sh. The initial write of CSVIngester.py was corrupted, but we rewrote it cleanly. We executed the CLI on src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv to produce tests/cleaned_data.csv and tests/cleaning_log.json; the terminal showed part of the generated log, indicating operations were logged. We have not yet fully verified the cleaned CSV contents, the end of the log, or the shell helper functions.",
  "plan": "- Verify tests directory and inspect cleaned CSV output and full JSON log to ensure consolidation, write_output, and parse operations are present.\n- Run CSV summary and a few helper commands via the Python CLI and the solve.sh functions to demonstrate functionality: encoding detection, name standardization, type detection, date parsing info, outlier truncate.\n- Re-run full pipeline via solve.sh to ensure the shell interface works and prints JSON.",
