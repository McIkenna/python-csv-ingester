  "analysis": "We implemented the Python CLI (solution/CSVIngester.py) with all required features: encoding detection (UTF-8/Latin-1), column name standardization to snake_case, column type detection (numeric/date/categorical), robust date parsing into ISO format, numeric imputation by median, categorical imputation with 'Unknown', outlier clipping at 1st/99th percentiles, consolidation of multiple CSVs, and detailed JSON logging. We also added a shell interface (solution/solve.sh) exposing the specified helper commands and fixed path resolution using BASH_SOURCE[0]. We successfully generated cleaned data and a JSON log from the sample CSVs, and partial log content was shown in the terminal. To finalize, we'll run a short verification of the shell helpers and full pipeline once more.",
  "plan": "1) Source the shell helpers. 2) Run encoding-detection, name-standardization, type-detection, and csv-summary to confirm helper commands work. 3) Run full pipeline via file-processing to produce output.csv and final_log.json. 4) Display the first lines of the produced outputs to verify.",
