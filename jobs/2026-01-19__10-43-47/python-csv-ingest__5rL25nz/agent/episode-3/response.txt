  "analysis": "We created the CLI and shell wrapper, installed dependencies, and verified the help and csv-summary, which works and shows correct rows/columns. However, running the full pipeline via file-processing produced an empty cleaned CSV (0 rows, 0 columns) and the log only contains the export_csv operation. This suggests our initial here-doc write of CSVIngester.py was corrupted; we overwrote it with a clean implementation. csv-summary still works, but file-processing still yields an empty DataFrame in the exported output. We need to directly test the other subcommands (dataframe-cleaning and dataframe-consolidation) and the default pipeline path to isolate where the emptiness arises.",
  "plan": "- Directly run the Python CLI with the default pipeline (without subcommand) on the two sample CSVs to see if that path produces a valid output and log.\n- Test dataframe-cleaning on a single file to see if processed_dataframe returns proper rows.\n- Test dataframe-consolidation subcommand to check the combined CSV output.\n- Inspect the outputs (wc -l, head) and the new logs to understand what operations are recorded.\n- Depending on these results, adjust if needed.",
