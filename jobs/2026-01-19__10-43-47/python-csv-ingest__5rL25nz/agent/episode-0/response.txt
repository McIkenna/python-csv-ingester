First, we should inspect the repo to see what's present, open tests to understand the expected interfaces/behaviors, then implement solution files accordingly. After implementation, run pytest and iterate until tests pass.",
  "plan": "- List current directory to view project structure.\n- Explore repository (solution, tests, src) to see what exists and what needs to be created.\n- Open tests/test_outputs.py to understand exact expected APIs, CLI args, and behaviors.\n- Create/implement solution/CSVIngester.py with required class and methods, and CLI entrypoint.\n- Create/implement solution/solve.sh with required bash functions wrapping Python methods.\n- Ensure executable permissions on scripts.\n- Optionally install Python dependencies if missing; attempt to run pytest to gauge failures and then iterate.\n- Run the test suite with pytest and fix issues as needed.",
