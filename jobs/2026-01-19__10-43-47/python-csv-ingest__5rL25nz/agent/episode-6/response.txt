  "analysis": "We set up the project structure and implemented the Python CLI (solution/CSVIngester.py) and shell wrapper (solution/solve.sh). Installed pandas, numpy, pytest. Initially, the script had corruption and argument parsing issues. We rewrote CSVIngester.py to a clean, robust implementation: handles encoding (utf-8/latin1), standardizes column names to snake_case, detects column types, parses dates to ISO-8601, imputes missing numeric with median and categoricals with 'Unknown', clips numeric outliers at 1st/99th percentiles, merges multiple cleaned DataFrames, and logs operations to JSON. We also fixed the CLI to support both subcommands and files-first mode. Running the full pipeline on src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv now yields a consolidated cleaned CSV with 20 rows and a detailed log, showing all operations (load_file, standardize_columns, detect_types, parse_dates, impute_missing, clip_outliers, consolidate, export_csv).",
  "plan": "- Verify the consolidated CSV has data (line count and sample head).\n- Verify the files-first mode produces output and log.\n- Display a snippet of the cleaning log operations for confirmation.",
