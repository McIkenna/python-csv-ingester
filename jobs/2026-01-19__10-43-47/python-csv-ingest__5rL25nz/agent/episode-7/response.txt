  "analysis": "The Python CLI and shell wrapper are implemented. The CLI supports multiple subcommands and a files-first mode. It standardizes column names, detects column types, parses dates to ISO-8601, imputes missing numerics with median and categoricals with 'Unknown', clips numeric outliers at the 1st/99th percentiles, consolidates multiple cleaned CSVs, and writes a detailed JSON log. Running the full pipeline on src/sample1_data.csv and src/sample2_data.csv produced a consolidated cleaned CSV with 20 rows and 15 columns, and the log shows all operations (load_file, standardize_columns, detect_types, parse_dates, impute_missing, clip_outliers, consolidate, export_csv). The shell script exposes the required commands.",
