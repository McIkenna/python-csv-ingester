  "analysis": "I see the issue now. The solve.sh script is designed as both a CLI tool (when run directly) and a function library (when sourced). The script checks if it's being run directly with the condition at the end. However, it seems the functions weren't properly loaded after the source command, possibly because the session was interrupted (I see 'asciinema: recording finished' in the output). Let me try sourcing it again and verify the functions are available.",
  "plan": "Source solve.sh again in the current shell and immediately check if the functions are defined using 'declare -F' to list all functions. Then test a few key functions to verify they work.",
