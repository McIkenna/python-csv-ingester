  "analysis": "I can see that solve.sh defines functions but with different names than what the documentation suggests. For example, it defines 'detect_encoding()' instead of 'encode_process()', and 'detect_column_type()' instead of 'find_column_type()'. The standardize_column_name() function worked earlier, so the script is sourced. I need to see all function names in solve.sh to understand the complete interface.",
