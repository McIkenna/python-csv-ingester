The process_files function successfully processed 3 CSV files, applied all required transformations (column standardization, date formatting, missing value imputation, outlier clipping), and generated both the cleaned CSV and comprehensive JSON log. The log shows detailed operations including load_file, standardize_columns, fill_missing_categorical, format_dates, outlier_truncate, and consolidate operations with timestamps.",
