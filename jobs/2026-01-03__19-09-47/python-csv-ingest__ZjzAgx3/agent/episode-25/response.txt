  "analysis": "I have thoroughly verified the implementation against all requirements:\n\n**Completed Requirements:**\n✅ Python CLI ingests multiple CSV inputs (tested with 3 files)\n✅ Handles inconsistent schemas with varying column names, encodings, and date formats\n✅ Standardizes column names to snake_case (e.g., 'Product Price $' → 'product_price')\n✅ ISO-formats dates to YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., '2023-10-01')\n✅ Imputes missing numericals by median (verified in tests)\n✅ Imputes missing categoricals as 'Unknown' (visible in output)\n✅ Clips numeric outliers at 1st/99th percentiles (documented in logs)\n✅ Outputs consolidated cleaned dataset (30 rows, 22 columns from 3 files)\n✅ Generates comprehensive JSON log with timestamps and operation details\n✅ Bash interface with all required functions working\n✅ All 23 tests passing (100% success rate)\n✅ All scripts properly executable\n\n**Testing Evidence:**\n- Full pytest suite: 23/23 PASSED\n- Python CLI tested successfully with multiple files\n- Bash functions tested: detect_encoding, detect_column_type, standardize_column_name, get_csv_summary, process_files\n- Output files verified with correct format and content\n- JSON logs contain all required operations (load_file, standardize_columns, fill_missing_categorical, format_dates, outlier_truncate, consolidate)\n\nThe solution is production-ready and meets all specifications.",
