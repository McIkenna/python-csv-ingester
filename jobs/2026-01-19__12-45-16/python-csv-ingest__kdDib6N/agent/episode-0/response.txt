  "analysis": "I'm in a fresh Linux environment at /app. The task is to implement a Python CLI tool for cleaning and consolidating CSV files with inconsistent schemas. Based on the instruction.md provided, I need to create a complete project with: 1) Main Python CLI (CSVIngester.py), 2) Bash shell interface (solve.sh), 3) Test suite (test_outputs.py), 4) Test data files, and 5) Supporting files. Currently, the terminal is ready but I need to check what already exists in the directory.",
  "plan": "First, I'll explore the current directory structure to see if any files already exist. Then I'll create the necessary directory structure (src/, solution/, tests/) and implement all required components systematically, starting with the main Python CLI, then the bash interface, test data generation, and finally the test suite.",
